# cronota

Version 1.0.1

[Japanese README](README.ja.md)

A stopwatch with notes.

## Features

- A stopwatch.
- A time logger: cronota logs time you spend for each line from your "notes".

## Usage

1. Visit [cronota](https://taidalog.github.io/cronota/).
1. Type or paste your "notes" to see while speaking.
1. Click "Start" button to start the stopwatch, and the first and second lines from your note will be displayed below the watch.
1. Click "Next" button, then the first line and the time you spend for it will be logged, and the second and third lines will be displayed below the watch.
1. Click "Next" button again, then the second line and the time you spend for it since last time you clicked "Next" will be logged, and next lines will be displayed. These processes will be repeated for each line.

Pasting your notes is recommended because reloading this page erases your notes.
